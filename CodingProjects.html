                <h3>May 2022 | C++</h3>
                <p>A program to calculate the total impedance of an analogue circuit was created. From an abstract
                  base class for circuit components, classes for a resistor, capacitor, and an inductor were derived.
                  After constructing a library of components, the user is then able to build a circuit using components 
                  from the library by making use of polymorphism. Smart pointers are utilised throughout
                  the code to create vectors of base class pointers. Two types of visual output of the circuit are
                  available to the user. Once the frequency of the circuit is set by the user, the impedance and
                  phase-shift of the whole circuit and each individual component is returned.

                <h3>March 2021 | Python</h3>
                <p>In this project Monte Carlo simulations were used to model the behaviour of thermal neutrons as they penetrate 
                  various shielding materials. Considering the only interactions of the neutrons with the shielding material atoms to 
                  be either absorption or scattering, the fraction of neutrons absorbed, reflected, or transmitted through varying 
                  thicknesses of water, lead, or graphite was calculated, along with the corresponding characteristic attenuation 
                  lengths. The effect of multiple slabs of different materials on the transmission of the neutrons was also
                  investigated using the woodcock method.</p>

                <h3>March 2021 | Python</h3>
                <p>The equation that describes the motion of a spring-mass system under an applied external force has no accessible
                  analytical solution. This aim of this code is to produce an accurate model of the spring-mass system. First, various numerical
                  methods were investigated and compared to the analytical solution of the system where there is no external force. Once the best
                  method was determined, it was used to model the behaviour of the oscillator under a non-zero external force. Then by weighing
                  accuracy against efficicency, the timestep for the numerical method was selected.
                  Verlet's method with the timestep ‚Ñé=0.1ùë† approximated the analytical solution very well in all of the cases. This chosen numerical
                  method was used to investigate the effect of damping, sudden forces, and sinusoidal forces on the system. Verlet's method also
                  approximated the resonance and phase difference curves of the system well.</p>

                <h3>December 2020 | Python</h3>
                <p>This data analysis code is used to analyse a system of a single planet orbiting a star using doppler spectroscopy.
                  The code took in data on the wavelengths of light observed from the star at different times. Once the data was validated,
                  a minimised chi squared fit for two parameters (star speed and angular velocity) was then performed. Anomalous data
                  points  are then removed and the fit is then repeated until no anomalous data points remain. A contour plot was used
                  to extract the errors on the fit parameters (pictured left). The additional quantities were then caculated: the distance
                  between the star and the planet, mass of the planet, the speed of the planet, and the period of the systems motion.
