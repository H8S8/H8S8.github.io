                <h3>May 2022</h3>
                <p> A program to calculate the total impedance of an analogue circuit was created. From an abstract
                  base class for circuit components, classes for a resistor, capacitor, and an inductor were derived.
                  After constructing a library of components, the user is then able to build a circuit using components 
                  from the library by making use of polymorphism. Smart pointers are utilised throughout
                  the code to create vectors of base class pointers. Two types of visual output of the circuit are
                  available to the user. Once the frequency of the circuit is set by the user, the impedance and
                  phase-shift of the whole circuit and each individual component is returned.

                <h3>March 2021</h3>
                <p> In this project Monte Carlo simulations were used to model the behaviour of thermal neutrons as they penetrate 
                  various shielding materials. Considering the only interactions of the neutrons with the shielding material atoms to 
                  be either absorption or scattering, the fraction of neutrons absorbed, reflected, or transmitted through varying 
                  thicknesses of water, lead, or graphite was calculated, along with the corresponding characteristic attenuation 
                  lengths. The effect of multiple slabs of different materials on the transmission of the neutrons was also
                  investigated using the woodcock method.</p>

                <h3>March 2021</h3>
                <p> We have studied the effect of different damping constants using Verlet's method with the chosen timestep ‚Ñé=0.1ùë†
                  , which approximated the analytical solution very well in all of the cases. The effect of a sudden force on free, 
                  undamped oscillations was then investigated. It was found that a 'push' at the equilibrium position would either 
                  increase or decrease the amplitude of oscillation. A push at the amplitude of oscillation would increase the amplitude 
                  of oscillation and introduce a phase shift. When driven with a sinusoidal forcing function, the amplitude of 
                  oscillation increases as the driving frequency gets closer to the natural frequency of the oscillator. Verlet's method 
                  approximated the resonance and phase difference curves well, the plots of sinusoidally forced oscillation indicated the 
                  same results that were found from these curves.</p>
