            I am a recent BSc Physics graduate from the University of Manchester.
            I am looking to start a career in tech.

            <h2>Why I want to start a career in tech</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>I am an avid problem
              solver, I can never resist having a go at a difficult puzzle. During my second year at university, I found that the modules
              I was enjoying the most all involved programming or data analysis. Since discovering this, I have endeavoured to broaden my skills by taking
              every programming course offered in my university program, joining the robotics society at my university, and taking online
              courses in my own time. By building a career in the technology industry, I hope to a continue to expand my coding knowledge
              and collaborate on projects that I find rewarding.</p>

            <h2>Additional hobbies and interests</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>I love arts and crafts including anything from printmaking to knitting. An ideal day out for me would be sketching at
              the British Museum or the Victoria & Albert Museum. During lockdown, I learned how to safely cycle on the road, cycling is
              now my preferred mode of transport where possible. I play clarinet, guitar, and sing, I love going to gigs and concerts.
              Most recently, I saw Joe Hisaishi conduct the Studio Ghibli soundtracks in London. My favourite way to relax is to go on a
              hike. In the future, I would like to learn British Sign Language.</p>
